          <h1>statistics made simple</h1>
          <p>Hi. This is an introductory paragraph. Welcome. You're here because either you're confused by statistics or you need a better explanation of a concept. Hopefully this page can provide you with some help. I'm writing this for undergrads to augment their coursework. I want to create living tutorials and inject as much play and interaction into relatively boring concepts.</p>

          <h2>descriptive statistics <a href="#descriptive-statistics">#</a></h2>
          <p>Descriptive statistics are exactly what you think. They describe what the data is or shows. They do not make a judgement about the data. They do not give any larger inference to a population from a sample. They describe a tendency of the data, or a breadth of the data.</p>
          <p>Let's start with a simple dataset of 15 random numbers between 0 and 50.</p>
          <p class="simple-dataset number"></p>

          <h2>central tendency</h2>
          <p>The mean, median, and mode are measures of central tendency. Each are used to show identifying characteristics of a dataset.</p>

          <h3>mean</h3>
          <p>A mean is commonly referred to as an average. It is the sum of the points divided by the number of points.</p>
          <p class="mean number"></p>

          <h3>median</h3>
          <p>A median is the middle point of a dataset. Half the points in the set lie before the median and half the points in the set lie after the median.</p>
          <p class="median number"></p>

          <h3>mode</h3>
          <p>The mode is the most commonly occurring point in a dataset.</p>
          <p class="mode number"></p>

          <h2>spread</h2>
          <p>The range, variance and standard deviation are all measures of spread for a dataset. These measures give an approximation of the breadth of the data.</p>

          <h3>range</h3>
          <p>The range is the maximum point in a dataset minus the minimum point in a dataset. In other terms, what does the dataset span?</p>
          <p class="range number"></p>

          <h3>variance</h3>
          <p>Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. In other words, the standard deviation squared.</p>
          <p class="variance number"></p>

          <h3>standard deviation</h3>
          <p>The standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation in a set of data. More commonly thought of as the average of the difference from the mean.</p>
          <p class="standard-deviation number"></p>

          <h3>z score</h3>
          <p>A z score indicates how many standard deviations a given number is away from the mean. Let's take a random point, <span class="z-point number"></span>, to calculate our z score. A z score is calculated by subtracting the point from the mean and then dividing by the standard deviation. In this case, the mean is <span class="mean number"></span> and standard deviation is <span class="standard-deviation number"></span>, therefore our z score indicates how many standard deviations <span class="z-point number"></span> is away from the mean value.</p>
          <p class="z-score number"></p>

          <h3>box and whisker plot</h3>
          <p>A box and whisker plot is a representation of a dataset showing multiple characteristics of that dataset. The plot below is a representation of our dataset.</p>
          <svg class="box"></svg>
          <p>Starting from the bottom line, called a whisker, we see the lowest possible value of the dataset displayed on the right.</p>
          <p>Moving upwards we encounter the "box", with the median value displayed on the right, and the 25th and 75th quartile values displayed on the left. As you might infer from the last sentence, each line in the plot divides a quartile. From the bottom whisker to the bottom line of the box representing 25% of the data values.</p>

          <h3>normal distribution</h3>
          <p>What is a normal distribution? Consider the hypothetical results of a biochemistry midterm exam below. Shown as a histogram with text scores 0-100 fitting into vertical bars. The higher the bar the more test scores were in that range of scores.</p>
          <p>
            <label class="normal-dist-label" for="numberOfPoints">number of scores on the exam: <span>50</span></label>
            <input id="normalPoints" class="mdl-slider mdl-js-slider" type="range" min="10" max="300" value="50" tabindex="0" name="numberOfPoints"/>
          </p>
          <svg class="normal-distribution"></svg>
          <p>
            <label class="mdl-switch mdl-js-switch mdl-js-ripple-effect" for="showCurve">
              <input type="checkbox" id="showCurve" class="mdl-switch__input"/>
              <span class="mdl-switch__label">show curve</span>
            </label>
          </p>

        <section id="sampling">
          <h2>sampling <a href="#sampling">#</a></h2>
          <p>Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals from a population. The basic theory of sampling is that a subset which has followed correct sampling techniques will be representative of the population. Creating a representative sampling frame would mean that the sample's makeup would closely match that of the population.</p>

          <h3>simple random sampling</h3>
          <p>Let's start with a sample population of circles. <span class="green-sample">Green</span> circles. <span class="red-sample">Red</span> circles. And <span class="blue-sample">blue</span> circles. How about a nice population size of <span class="sample-population"></span>.</p>
          <p>Once you're happy with our population. Click the switch to take a sample from the population. In this case we'll start with a <strong>simple random sample</strong>. Which means each circle has an equal chance to be selected and can only be selected only once, which is referred to as sampling without replacement.</p>
          <svg class="sampling-population"></svg>
          <p>
            <label class="mdl-switch mdl-js-switch mdl-js-ripple-effect" for="sampleSwitch">
              <input type="checkbox" id="sampleSwitch" class="mdl-switch__input"/>
              <span class="mdl-switch__label">sample</span>
            </label>
          </p>
          <p>
            <label class="sampleSize-dist-label" for="sampleSize">sample size: <span>50</span></label>
            <input id="sampleSize" class="mdl-slider mdl-js-slider" type="range" min="10" max="300" value="50" tabindex="0" name="sampleSize"/>
          </p>
          <p>The first thing you'll notice when playing with the sample size is just how much your representation of each color can vary from sample to sample. Intuitively, the larger your sample size the more likely the sample is to be a closer approximation to the population and thus representative.</p>
